# Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone. All participants are expected to follow these
guidelines:

1. Be respectful and inclusive. Assume positive intent and collaborate constructively.
2. Do not engage in harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
3. Respect differing viewpoints, experiences, and cultural backgrounds.
4. Provide considerate and constructive feedback.
5. Report incidents to the maintainers at <mohsen57a@gmail.com> so concerns can be addressed promptly.

Violations may result in temporary or permanent bans from project spaces. This policy applies to all project channels including
GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any synchronous communication related to the project.
