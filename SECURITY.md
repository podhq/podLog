# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The latest minor release of podlog receives security fixes. Older releases may receive fixes at the maintainers' discretion.

## Reporting a vulnerability

1. Email <mohsen57a@gmail.com> with the subject line `SECURITY`.
2. Include detailed reproduction steps, affected versions, and any relevant configuration snippets.
3. We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and coordinate a timeline for remediation and disclosure.

Please avoid opening public issues for security reports so that fixes can be prepared before disclosure.
